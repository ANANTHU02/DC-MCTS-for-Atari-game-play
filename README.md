# DC-MCTS-for-Atari-game-play


This project investigates the application of Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) and its extension, Divide and Conquer Monte Carlo Tree Search
(DC-MCTS), to games and decision-making. MCTS is a simulation-based
algorithm that enables optimal decision-making in complex and stochastic
environments. However, conventional MCTS algorithms face challenges
in handling games containing hidden information and large state spaces.
DC-MCTS overcomes these limitations by dividing the search space into
smaller subtrees, improving efficiency and effectiveness. In this project, we
examine the advantages of DC-MCTS over traditional MCTS algorithms,
address related challenges, and compare performance. Additionally, new
applications for MCTS, such as self-driving cars and natural language
processing, are being explored, demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s versatility
beyond games. Through this project, we will deepen our understanding
of MCTS and DC-MCTS, and contribute to the development of game
strategies and decision support systems.


Problem Statement

Traditional Monte Carlo tree search algorithms (MCTS) reach their limits when
applied to complex games with large state spaces or games with hidden or incomplete information. These limitations affect the effectiveness and efficiency of
decision making. Additionally, MCTS scalability and performance can be challenging, especially in scenarios that require load balancing and subtree merging.
Therefore, we need improved algorithms that can overcome these limitations and
improve the performance of MCTS when dealing with complex games with large
state spaces and hidden information. This project aims to address these challenges by investigating the application of the divide-and-conquer Monte Carlo
tree search (DC-MCTS) algorithm, which divides the search space into smaller
subtrees for more targeted searches. and This project explores the advantages of
DC-MCTS compared to traditional MCTS algorithms and analyzes their performance to gain insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of DC-MCTS when
tackling complex gaming and decision-making scenarios.
